## 🔥 Future Projects

### 📍 **Kote**
- **Description**: Kote is a platform that combines the features of review-based services like TripAdvisor and Yelp with the ability for businesses to host their own websites directly on the platform. Each business gets a personalized profile, along with the option to create a custom URL (e.g., restaurantname@kote.com) for their website. Users can discover, review, and interact with businesses, while business owners have the convenience of managing their profiles and hosting websites all in one place.
- **Goal**: To provide a seamless platform where users can search, discover, and review local businesses, while offering business owners an easy way to host their own website, engage with customers, and gain insights into their business performance. The platform also aims to tackle the problem of “polluted” search results, where restaurant listings often display outdated or abandoned websites. Kote ensures businesses have an active, up-to-date online presence without the issue of neglected websites cluttering search results.
